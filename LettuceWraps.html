    These lettuce wraps are bursting with Asian flavors, delicious,
    and a great idea for entertaining or a family-style meal.

    like a burrito and enjoy!
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 butter lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>1 kg lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li> 1 large onlin chopped</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup worcester sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves fresh garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced pickled ginger</li>
        <li>1 (200 g) can water chestnuts, drained and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons (dark) sesame oil</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>

    Rinse whole lettuce leaves and pat dry, being careful not to tear them; set aside.

    <h4>Step 2</h4>

    Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
    Add beef; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 
    5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease; transfer beef 
    to a bowl. Add onion to the same skillet; cook and stir 
    until just tender, 5 to 7 minutes.

    <h4>Step 3</h4>

    Stir in hoisin sauce, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, 
    and chile pepper sauce until well combined. Add water chestnuts, 
    green onions, sesame oil, and cooked beef; cook and stir until 
    the onions just begin to wilt, about 2 minutes.

    <h4>Step 4</h4>

    Arrange lettuce leaves around the outer edge of a large serving 
    platter; spoon beef mixture in the center
